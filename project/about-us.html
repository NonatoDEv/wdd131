                <h2>Honoring a Legacy of Love</h2>  
                <p class="dedication-intro">
                    Baby Lucy is more than a store; it is a tribute to a legacy that began in <strong>1996</strong> with my mother, <strong>Luzarmenia</strong>. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    She founded this business with dedication and a simple belief: that every baby deserves to be wrapped in love and quality. She taught us that baby clothes are more than just fabric—they are the wrapper for your most precious memories.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though she is no longer with us, her spirit remains the foundation of everything we do. To honor her memory and the light she brought into our lives, we named our daughter <strong>Lucy</strong>—a reflection of her name and her enduring warmth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, my wife and I continue what she started. We carefully select every piece in our collection, guided by the values she taught us: <strong>integrity, care, and family</strong>.

                <h2>Meet the New Generation</h2>
                <p>
                    Hi! We are the proud parents behind Baby Lucy. While honoring the past is vital, building the future is our passion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>My Wife</strong> is the heart of the store. With her "mom instinct," she hand-picks every garment, asking one simple question: <em>"Would I dress Lucy in this?"</em> If the answer isn't a resounding yes, it doesn't make it to our shelves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>And I am Abel</strong>. I work behind the scenes to make sure your shopping experience is smooth and easy. From writing the code for this website to packing your orders with care, I ensure the legacy runs strong.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Together, we promise you the same warmth and dedication my mother started back in '96. Thank you for letting us be part of your family's journey.
                </p>
